netmask: 255.255.255.128(/25)
=> we have 128 IP addresses to split.

For each Network N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, we need an extra IP for the router besides the usable x IP's, and we need to add 2 also because we can't use the first and last address, because they are reserved: the network address(1st address in the network range), the broadcast address(last address in the network range).
So if we need x IP's for a network, we have to make sure we have space for x+3 IP's.
